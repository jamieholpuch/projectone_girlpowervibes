# Bootcamp SIMS

## Description
Bootcamp SIMS is a fun, simulation game designed to help potential web development students learn exactly what to expect before deciding to attend coding bootcamp. As they navigate the three levels of bootcamp (enrollment, learning and their first project), they’ll have to make some tough decisions along the way. In the end, they’ll find out if they should take the next step and attend coding bootcamp or maybe give it another thought.
